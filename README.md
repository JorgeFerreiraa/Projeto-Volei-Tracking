# 🏐 Volleyball Player Tracking & Heatmap Analysis with YOLOv8

This project applies **YOLOv8** and computer vision techniques to detect and track **volleyball players** in match videos.  
In addition to player detection, the system generates **heatmaps of player movement** and calculates **time-based statistics**, providing insights into positioning and performance.  

📌 **Developed in partnership with [Esmoriz Ginásio Clube]([https://www.facebook.com/esmorizginasioclube](https://www.facebook.com/esmorizgc))**
